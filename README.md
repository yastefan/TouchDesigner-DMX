# TouchLED - A TouchDesigner LED and DMX Library

TouchLED is a library to simplify the control of LEDs and DMX fixtures in TouchDesigner and to provide a consistent workflow. A visualiser enables the creation of complex mappings without additional hardware or software.
For all those who are not yet familiar with TouchDesigner: You get a professional (for non-commercial purposes) free LED mapping solution with endless creative possibilities.

## Concept

LEDs or fixtures are arranged in SOPs in 3D space. Each individual point simbolises a pixel or DMX parameter. The SOP input is displayed on a selectable plane in order to display video content (TOPs) on the LEDs/fixtures.
